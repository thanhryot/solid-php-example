### SOLID Principles Simplified with Examples in PHP

##### (S) Single Responsibility Principle
> A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

##### (O) Open Closed Principle
> A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

##### (L) Liskov Substitution Principle
> Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

##### (I) Interface Segregation Principle
> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

##### (D) Dependency Inversion Principle
> Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.
